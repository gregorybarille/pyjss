#PYJSS is currently in development. More details will come when the project will be more advanced.

Needs to be done:

1. Write all the **GET** methods for all API endpoints (if available)
2. Write all **DELETE** methods for all API endpoints  (if available)
3. Write all **POST** methods for all API endpoints  (if available)
4. Write all the necessary **TEST**
5. Needs to decide how to implement the **PUT** methods, how far to go with the parsing
6. I will start asking for user to test the first version of the package and get their **Feedback**
7. **Publish** the package

Additionnal steps will be added if necessary and the order modified.
