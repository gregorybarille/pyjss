#PYJSS is currently in development. More details will come when the project will be more advanced.

For basic usage info check the [wiki](https://github.com/sillegue/pyjss/wiki)

Needs to be done:

1. Add xml templates for **Post** Methods
2. Create the ability to use an auth file instead of storing it in a keychain
3. Write all the necessary comments / inline documentation / wiki page
4. I will start asking for user to test the first version of the package and get their **Feedback**
5. **Publish** the package
6. Will be done depending on the feedback given.


Additionnal steps will be added if necessary and the order modified.
