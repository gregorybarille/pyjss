#PYJSS is currently in development. More details will come when the project will be more advanced.

Needs to be done:

~~Write all the **GET** methods for all API endpoints~~ Done
~~Write all **DELETE** methods for all API endpoints  (if available)~~
~~Add a *parser* for the class Methods arguments.~~ ( Not necessary at the moment)
1. ~~Write all **POST** methods for all API endpoints~~ / add xml templates
2. Create the ability to use an auth file instead of storing it in a keychain
3. Write all the necessary comments / inline documentation
4. Write all the necessary **TEST**
5. Needs to decide how to implement the **PUT** methods, how far to go with the parsing
6. Create a documentation on the package usage
7. I will start asking for user to test the first version of the package and get their **Feedback**
8. **Publish** the package


Additionnal steps will be added if necessary and the order modified.
